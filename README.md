### You will find several of my projects in the repository folders

## Gift Exchange Effort Timing - PhD Project:
This is my oTree code and replication code for my solo-authored paper "Effort Timing and Reciprocity in the Gift Exchange". Inside the "Otree Experiments" subfolder, you can find my Otree code for all three of my gift exchange treatments. Otree is a combination of Python, JavaScript, and CSS/HTML. You need to install oTree to your computer to run it.

Inside the "Data" subfolder, you will find my replication file "Gift Exchange Stats and Graphs.py". All the data is located in the appropriate folder under each treatment. Aggregate graphs are found in the Data subfolder.

## Spotify Data Cleaning

This is a simple data cleaning project I conducted using the Spotify Top Songs 2024 data. You can find the original data, the cleaned data, and my .sql file in the folder. The data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024.

# Patrick Tydir GitHub Portfolio

#### You will find several of my projects in the repository folders.

## Gift Exchange Effort Timing - Data Visualization:

This project contains my replication code for my solo-authored paper "Effort Timing and Reciprocity in the Gift Exchange," as well as all of the tables, graphs, and statistics I created using Python and R. The vast majority of the analysis uses python, so the R file is barebones.

Inside the main folder, you will find my Python replication file "Data Analysis and Visualization.py", the R replication file, "stats.R", as well as all of the aggregate graphs and tables.
The data is omitted because the paper has not been published, yet. To give you an idea of the data structure, each session subfolder has an excel file named "Transactions.xlsx". In addition, I export a compiled data set named "r\_data.csv", which is also omitted.

Inside the "Effort After" and "Effort Before" subfolders, you will find subfolders for Sessions 1-7. Each session folder has graphs to visualize the data from that session, as well as summary statistics.

If you would like a copy of the working paper, please feel free to contact me. I am more than happy to share my work.

## Spotify Data Cleaning

This is a simple data cleaning project I conducted using the Spotify Top Songs 2024 data. You can find the original data, the cleaned data, and my .sql file in the folder. The data was downloaded from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024.

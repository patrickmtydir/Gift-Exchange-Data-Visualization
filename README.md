## Gift Exchange - Data Visualization:

This project contains my replication code for the data visualizations of my solo-authored paper, "Effort Timing and Reciprocity in the Gift Exchange," which I created using Python.

Inside the repository, you will find my Python replication file "Gift Exchange Data Visualization.py". Inside the "Aggregate Graphs" folder, you will find as all of the aggregate/treatment graphs and data visualizations. 

Inside the "After After" and "Effort Before" folders, you will find the data visuializations for individual sessions.

The data is omitted because the paper has not been published, yet. To give you an idea of the data structure, each session subfolder has an excel file named "Transactions.xlsx". In addition, I export a compiled data set named "r\_data.csv", which is also omitted.

If you would like a copy of the working paper, please feel free to contact me. I am more than happy to share my work.
